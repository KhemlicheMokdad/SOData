37871,"<p>On my way through whipping up a Windows Forms application I thought it might have been a good idea to use the settings file to store miscellaneous application options (instead of the registry) and user parameters (window positions, column orderings, etc.). Out of the box, quick and simple, or so I thought.</p>

<p>All works as per MSDN using the default SettingsProvider (LocalFileSettingsProvider), but I do have concerns about where it gets stored and hopefully somebody can provide a solution. Essentially the file ends up in the local application data and in an unsavoury sub-directory structure. (AppData / Local / <em>company</em> / <em>namespace_StrongName_gibberish</em> / <em>version</em> ).</p>

<p>The application in question is a Java/J2EE based web app that uses Hibernate.  The way I currently have things working is that the Hibernate mapped model objects all implement a common ""Indexable"" interface that can return a set of key/value pairs that are recorded in Lucene.

<p>Last year, I did an internship in a physics research group at a university. In this group, we mostly used <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LabVIEW"" rel=""noreferrer"">LabVIEW</a> to write programs for controlling our setups, doing data acquisition and analyzing our data. For the first two purposes, that works quite OK, but for data analysis, it's a real pain. On top of that, everyone was mostly self-taught, so code that was written was generally quite a mess (no wonder that every PhD quickly decided to rewrite everything from scratch). Version control was unknown, and impossible to set up because of strict software and network regulations from the IT department.</p>

<p>Now, things actually worked out surprisingly OK, but how do people in the natural sciences do their software development?</p>

<p>Some concrete questions:</p>

<ul>
<li>What languages/environments have you used for developing scientific software, especially data analysis? What libraries? (for example, what do you use for plotting?)</li>
<li>Was there any training for people without any significant background in programming?</li>
<li>Did you have anything like version control, and bug tracking?</li>
<li>How would you go about trying to create a decent environment for programming, without getting too much in the way of the individual scientists (especially physicists are stubborn people!)</li>

38302,"<p>I'm currently working on a ray-tracer in C# as a hobby project. I'm trying to achieve a decent rendering speed by implementing some tricks from a c++ implementation and have run into a spot of trouble.</p>

<p>The objects in the scenes which the ray-tracer renders are stored in a KdTree structure and the tree's nodes are, in turn, stored in an array. The optimization I'm having problems with is while trying to fit as many tree nodes as possible into a cache line. One means of doing this is for nodes to contain a pointer to the left child node only. It is then implicit that the right child follows directly after the left one in the array.</p>

<p>The nodes are structs and during tree construction they are succesfully put into the array by a static memory manager class. When I begin to traverse the tree it, at first, seems to work just fine. Then at a point early in the rendering (about the same place each time), the left child pointer of the root node is suddenly pointing at a null pointer. I have come to the conclusion that the garbage collecter has moved the structs as the array lies on the heap.</p>

<p>I've tried several things to pin the addresses in memory but none of them seems to last for the entire application lifetime as I need. The 'fixed' keyword only seems to help during single method calls and declaring 'fixed' arrays can only be done on simple types which a node isn't. Is there a good way to do this or am I just too far down the path of stuff C# wasn't meant for.</p>

38428,"<p>THis is a followup to my previous question ""<a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/37306/font-dependent-control-positioning"">Font-dependent control positioning.</a>"" It's an attempt to solve the <em>real</em> problem behind that question, perhaps in ways different than the one I was asking about.</p>

<p><strong>Example of the problem statement:</strong> I want a checkbox that says ""Adjust prices by <em>&lt;X&gt;</em> <em>&lt;Y&gt;</em> after loading,"" where <em>&lt;X&gt;</em> is a number---adjustable with a <code>NumericUpDown</code>---and <em>&lt;Y&gt;</em> is either ""percent"" or ""dollars,"" with the choices being made by a <code>ComboBox</code>. This will be on a single line.</p>

<p><strong>The complication:</strong> I want to be able to change my fonts for all these controls (basically setting them to <code>System.Drawing.Fonts.MessageBoxFont</code>, which is Tahoma 8 pt on Windows XP/etc. and Segoe UI 9 pt on Vista), without messing up my layout, which with my current <code>Position</code>-property--setting paradigm does not work.</p>

<p>More generally, I'd like the controls to be dynamically laid out in a font-independent way, so that the <em>&lt;X&gt;</em> <code>NumericUpDown</code> fits snugly into the space between ""by "" and the <em>&lt;Y&gt;</em> <code>ComboBox</code>, and similarly the <em>&lt;X&gt;</em> <code>ComboBox</code> fits in with respect to the <em>&lt;X&gt;</em> <code>CheckBox</code> and the string "" after loading"" to its right.</p>

<p><strong>The part everyone seems to miss:</strong> This is all nested within a <code>CheckBox</code>. So, ideally, clicking on the words ""after loading"" should check/uncheck the checkbox, and draw that little highlight rectangle around ""Adjust prices by&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;after loading."" So just slapping an extra <code>Label</code> on the end doesn't work, because then it doesn't toggle the <code>CheckBox</code>; similarly, trying to band-aid things by hooking up such a <code>Label</code>'s <code>Click</code> event won't produce the desired highlight-rectangle.</p>

<p><strong>Solutions?</strong> At this point I'm thinking either:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Rethink the problem, somehow, maybe with an ugly solution like two separate lines of text: ""Adjust found prices after loading"" (<code>CheckBox</code>), ""Adjustment amount:"" (<code>NumericUpDown</code> and <code>ComboBox</code>). This is really bad because my options box is absolutely full of options of this type (i.e. the type in the example), so it would at least double in vertical size.</p></li>
<li><p>Some sort of custom control? <code>SplittableCheckBox</code>?</p></li>
<li><p>Some kind of magic with a <code>TableLayout</code> control? (Pretty sure this fails at ""the part everyone seems to miss.)</p></li>

38501,"<p>I'm trying to come up with a design for a thread pool with a lot of design requirements for my job. This is a real problem for working software, and it's a difficult task. I have a working implementation but I'd like  to throw this out to SO and see what interesting ideas people can come up with, so that I can compare to my implementation and see how it stacks up. I've tried to be as specific to the requirements as I can.</p>

<p>The thread pool needs to execute a series of tasks. The tasks can be short running (&lt;1sec) or long running (hours or days). Each task has an associated priority (from 1 = very low to 5 = very high). Tasks can arrive at any time while the other tasks are running, so as they arrive the thread pool needs to pick these up and schedule them as threads become available.</p>

<p>The task priority is completely independant of the task length. In fact it is impossible to tell how long a task could take to run without just running it.</p>

<p>Some tasks are CPU bound while some are greatly IO bound. It is impossible to tell beforehand what a given task would be (although I guess it might be possible to detect while the tasks are running).</p>

<p>The primary goal of the thread pool is to maximise throughput. The thread pool should effectively use the resources of the computer. Ideally, for CPU bound tasks, the number of active threads would be equal to the number of CPUs. For IO bound tasks, more threads should be allocated than there are CPUs so that blocking does not overly affect throughput. Minimising the use of locks and using thread safe/fast containers is important.</p>

<p>In general, you should run higher priority tasks with a higher CPU priority (ref: SetThreadPriority). Lower priority tasks should not ""block"" higher priority tasks from running, so if a higher priority task comes along while all low priority tasks are running, the higher priority task will get to run.</p>

<p>The tasks have a ""max running tasks"" parameter associated with them. Each type of task is only allowed to run at most this many concurrent instances of the task at a time. For example, we might have the following tasks in the queue:</p>

<ul>
<li>A - 1000 instances - low priority - max tasks 1</li>
<li>B - 1000 instances - low priority - max tasks 1</li>
<li>C - 1000 instances - low priority - max tasks 1</li>
</ul>

<p>A working implementation could only run (at most) 1 A, 1 B and 1 C at the same time.</p>

<p>It needs to run on Windows XP, Server 2003, Vista and Server 2008 (latest service packs).</p>

<p>My current solution involves using IPHelper's ""<a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa365920(VS.85).aspx"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">GetBestInterface</a>"" function and supplying it with the IP address ""0.0.0.0"".</p>

<p>Do you have any other solutions you might suggest to this problem?</p>

<p>Following some of the answers, let me elaborate:</p>

<ul>
<li>I need this because I have a product that has to choose which adapter to bind to. I have no way of controlling the setup of the network or the host where the product will run and so I need a solution that is as robust as possible, with as few assumptions as possible.</li>
<li>I need to do this in code, since this is part of a product.</li>
</ul>

<p>@Chris Upchurch: This makes me dependent on google.com being up (usually not a problem) and on any personal firewall that might be installed to allow pinging.</p>

<p>@Till: Like Steve Moon said, relying on the adapter's address is kind of risky because you make a lot of assumptions on the internal network setup.</p>

<p>@Steve Moon: Looking at the routing table sounds like a good idea, but instead of applying the routing logic myself, I am trying to use ""GetBestInterface"" as described above. I believe what it should do is exactly what you outlined in your answer, but I am not really sure. The reason I'm reluctant to implement my own ""routing logic"" is that there's a better chance that I'll get it wrong than if I use a library/API written and tested by more ""hard-core"" network people.</p>

<li>User: UserID (PK), FirstName, LastName</li>

<li>UserWidgets2: WidgetID (PK, FK), UserID (PK, FK)</li>

However, this seems unnecessary since the only data being stored in the table is the relationship between the two primary tables, and this relationship itself can form a unique key. Thus leading to option 2, which has a two-column primary key, but loses the one-column unique identifier that option 1 has. I could also optionally add a two-column unique index (WidgetID, UserID) to the first table.</p>

39503,"<p>I need to modify the MBR of Windows, and I would really like to do this from Windows.</p>

<p>Here are my questions. I know that I can get a handle on a physical device with a call to CreateFile. Will the MBR always be on \\.\PHYSICALDRIVE0? Also, I'm still learning the Windows API to read directly from the disk. Is readabsolutesectors and writeabsolutesectdors the two functions I'm going to need to use to read/write to the disk sectors which contain the MBR?</p>

<p>Edit from from what I've learned on my own.
The MBR will not always be on \\.\PHYSICALDRIVE0. Also, you can write to the bootsector (at least as Administrator on XP) by call CreateFile with the device name of the drive that contains the MBR. Also, you can write to this drive by simply calling WriteFile and passing the handle of the device created by calling CreateFile.</p>

<p>Edit to address Joel Coehoorn. 
I need to edit the MBR because I'm working on a project that needs to modify hardware registers after POST in BIOS, but before Windows will be allowed to boot. Our plan is to make these changes by modifying the bootloader to execute our code before Windows boots up. </p>

<p>Edit for Cd-MaN.
Thanks for the info. There isn't anything in your answer, though, that I didn't know and your answer doesn't address my question. The registry in particular absolutely will not do what we need for multiple reasons. The big reason being that Windows is the highest layer among multiple software layers that will be running with our product. These changes need to occur even before the lower levels run, and so the registry won't work. </p>

<p>P.S. for Cd-MaN.
As I understand it, the information you give isn't quite correct. For Vista, I think you can write to a volume if the sectors being written to are boot sectors. See <a href=""http://support.microsoft.com/kb/942448"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/942448</a></p>

39525,"<p>I've encountered the following problem pattern frequently over the years:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>I'm writing complex code for a package comprised of a standalone application and also a library version of the core that people can use from inside other apps.</p></li>
<li><p>Both our own app and presumably ones that users create with the core library are likely to be run both in batch mode (off-line, scripted, remote, and/or from command line), as well as interactively.</p></li>
<li><p>The library/app takes complex and large runtime input and there may be a variety of error-like outputs including severe error messages, input syntax warnings, status messages, and run statistics.  Note that these are all <em>incidental</em> outputs, not the primary purpose of the application which would be displayed or saved elsewhere and using different methods.</p></li>
<li><p>Some of these (probably only the very severe ones) might require a dialog box if run interactively; but it needs to log without stalling for user input if run in batch mode; and if run as a library the client program obviously wants to intercept and/or examine the errors as they occur.</p></li>
<li><p>It all needs to be cross-platform: Linux, Windows, OSX.  And we want the solution to not be weird on any platform.  For example, output to stderr is fine for Linux, but won't work on Windows when linked to a GUI app.</p></li>
<li><p>Client programs of the library may create multiple instances of the main class, and it would be nice if the client app could distinguish a separate error stream with each instance.</p></li>
<li><p>Let's assume everybody agrees it's good enough for the library methods to log errors via a simple call (error code and/or severity, then printf-like arguments giving an error message).  The contentious part is how this is recorded or retrieved by the client app.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>I've done this many times over the years, and am never fully satisfied with the solution.  Furthermore, it's the kind of subproblem that's actually not very important to users (they want to see the error log if something goes wrong, but they don't really care about our technique for implementing it), but the topic gets the programmers fired up and they invariably waste inordinate time on this detail and are never quite happy.</p>

39628,"<p>In my <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/39371/database-exception-handling-best-practices"">previous question</a> most commenters agreed that having validation logic both at client &amp; server sides is a good thing.  </p>

<p>However there is a problem - you need to keep your validation rules in sync between database and client code.  </p>

<p>So the question is how can we deal with it ?  </p>

<p>One approach is to use ORM techniques, modern ORM tools can produce code that can take care of data validation prior sending it to the server.  </p>

However, this one in particular has the need that some users will be offline, so they need to be able to download the DB to their machine, work on it, and then sync back once they're on the LAN.</p>

40242,"<p>I joined a new company about a month ago. The company is rather small in size and has pretty strong ""start-up"" feel to it. I'm working as a Java developer on a team of 3 others. The company primarily sells a service to for businesses/business-type people to use in communicating with each other.</p>

<p>One of the main things I have been, and will be working on, is the main website for the company - from which the service is sold, existing users login to check their service and pay their bills, new users can sign up for a trial, etc. Currently this is a JSP application deployed on Tomcat, with access to a database done thru a persistence layer written by the company itself.</p>

<p>A repeated and growing frustration I am having here (and I'm pretty happy with the job overall, so this isn't an ""oh no I don't like my job""-type post) is the lack of any larger design or architecture for this web application. The app is made up of several dozen JSP pages, with almost no logic existing in Servlets or Beans or any other sort of framework. Many of the JSP pages are thousands of lines of code, they <code>jsp:include</code> other JSP pages, business logic is mixed in with the HTML, frequently used snippets of code (such as obtaining a web service connection) is cut and paste rather than reused, etc. In other words, the application is a mess.</p>

<p>There have been some rumblings within the company of trying to re-architect this site so that it fits MVC better; I think that the developers and higher-ups are beginning to realize that this current pattern of spaghetti code isn't sustainable or very easily scalable to add more features for the users. The higher-ups and developers are wary of completely re-writing the thing (with good reason, since this would mean several weeks or months of work re-writing existing functionality), but we've had some discussions of (slowly) re-writing certain areas of the site into a new framework.</p>

<p>What are some of the best strategies to enable moving the application and codebase into this direction? How can I as a developer really help move this along, and quickly, without seeming like the jerk-y new guy who comes into a job and tells everyone that what they've written is crap? Are there any proven strategies or experiences that you've used in your own job experience when you've encountered this sort of thing?</p>

<p>Is it better to use window.onload to do this functionality or have a script block after the DOM elements I need to modify?  For either case, why is it better?</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<pre><code>function updateDOM(id) {
    // updates the id element based on form state

<p>I'm trying to convert a .Net dataset into an XML stream, transform it with an xsl file in memory, then output the result to a new XML file. </p>

<p>Here's the current solution:</p>

        XmlDocument originalXml = new XmlDocument();

        XmlDocument transformedXml = new XmlDocument();

        XslCompiledTransform transformer = new XslCompiledTransform();

        DataSet ds = new DataSet();

        string filepath;

        originalXml.LoadXml(ds.GetXml()); //data loaded prior

        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();

        XmlWriter writer = XmlWriter.Create(sb);

        transformer.Load(transformXML);

        transformer.Transform(originalXml, writer); //no need to select the node

        transformedXml.LoadXml(sb.ToString());

        transformedXml.Save(filepath);

        writer.Close();
</code></pre>

<p>Here's the original code:</p>

<pre><code>BufferedStream stream = new BufferedStream(new MemoryStream());

DataSet ds = new DataSet();

da.Fill(ds);

ds.WriteXml(stream);

StreamReader sr = new StreamReader(stream, true);

stream.Position = 0; //I'm not certain if this is necessary, but for the StreamReader to read the text the position must be reset.

XmlReader reader = XmlReader.Create(sr, null);  //Problem is created here, the XmlReader is created with none of the data from the StreamReader

XslCompiledTransform transformer = new XslCompiledTransform();

transformer.Load(@""&lt;path to xsl file&gt;"");

transformer.Transform(reader, null, writer); //Exception is thrown here, though the problem originates from the XmlReader.Create(sr, null)
</code></pre>

<p>For some reason in the transformer.Transform method, the reader has no root node, in fact the reader isn't reading anything from the StreamReader.</p>

I've been looking at a few PHP framework recently, and it came down to two. The Zend Framework or CodeIgniter. </p>

<p>I prefer CodeIgniter, because of its simple design. It's very bare bone, and it is just kept simple. The thing I don't like though is the weak template system. The template system is important for me, because I will be working with another designer. Being able to give him a good template system is a big plus.</p>

<p>Zend was the second choice, because of the better template system that is built in. Zend is a different beast though compared to CodeIgniter. It emphasis ""loose coupling between modules"", but is a bigger framework. I don't like to feel like I have many things running under the hood that I never use. That is unnecessary overhead in my opinion, so I thought about putting a template system into CodeIgniter: Smarty.</p>

<p><strong>Question(s)</strong>: How easy/hard is the process to integrate Smarty into CodeIgniter? From my initial scan of the CodeIgniter documentation, I can see that the layout of the framework is easy enough to understand, and I anticipate no problems. I want to know if anyone has used it before, and therefore are aware of any ""gotchas"" you my have experienced that is going to make this harder than it should be or impossible to pull off. I also want to know if this is a good thing to do at all. Is the template system in CodeIgniter enough for normal use? Are there any other template modules that are good for CodeIgniter aside from Smarty? I better off with Zend Framework? Is any wheel being invented here? Thank you for your help! </p>

  <p>Figure out which importer handles your type of file</p>

<p>I'm not sure if my type of file is handled by any single importer? Since they've all got weird extensions (.aux, .glo, .out, whatever) I think it's improbable that there's an importer that's <em>trying</em> to index them. But because they're plain text they're being picked up as generic files. (Admittedly, I don't know much about Spotlight's indexing, so I might be completely wrong on this.)</p>

1) Define scaling. Do you need to scale for lots of users, traffic, objects in a virtual environment?<br>
2) Look at your algorithms. Will the amount of work they do scale linearly with the actual amount of work - i.e. number of items to loop through, number of users, etc?<br>
3) Look at your hardware. Is your application designed such that you can run it on multiple machines if one can't keep up?  </p>

<p><strong>Secondary thoughts</strong><br>
1) Don't optimize too much too soon - test first. Maybe bottlenecks will happen in unforseen places.<br>

41479,"<p>After discussion with colleagues regarding the use of the 'var' keyword in C# 3 I wondered what people's opinions were on the appropriate uses of type inference via var?</p>

<p>For example I rather lazily used var in questionable circumstances, e.g.:-</p>

<pre><code>foreach(var item in someList) { // ... } // Type of 'item' not clear.
var something = someObject.SomeProperty; // Type of 'something' not clear.
var something = someMethod(); // Type of 'something' not clear.
</code></pre>

<p>More legitimate uses of var are as follows:-</p>

<pre><code>var l = new List&lt;string&gt;(); // Obvious what l will be.
var s = new SomeClass(); // Obvious what s will be.
</code></pre>

<p>Interestingly LINQ seems to be a bit of a grey area, e.g.:-</p>

<pre><code>var results = from r in dataContext.SomeTable
              select r; // Not *entirely clear* what results will be here.
</code></pre>

<p>It's clear what results will be in that it will be a type which implements IEnumerable, however it isn't entirely obvious in the same way a var declaring a new object is.</p>

<p>It's even worse when it comes to LINQ to objects, e.g.:-</p>

<pre><code>var results = from item in someList
              where item != 3
              select item;
</code></pre>

<p>This is no better than the equivilent foreach(var item in someList) { // ... } equivilent.</p>

<p>There is a real concern about type safety here - for example if we were to place the results of that query into an overloaded method that accepted IEnumerable&lt;int&gt; and IEnumerable&lt;double&gt; the caller might inadvertently pass in the wrong type.</p>

<p><code>var</code> <em>does</em> maintain strong typing but the question is really whether it's dangerous for the type to not be immediately apparent on definition, something which is magnified when overloads mean compiler errors might not be issued when you unintentionally pass the wrong type to a method.</p>

41580,"<p>I'm working on an automated regression test suite for an app which I maintain.  While developing the automated regression test, I ran across some behavior that's almost certainly a bug.  So, for now, I've modified the automated regression test to not register a failure--it's deliberately allowing this bad behavior to go by, I mean.  </p>

<p>So, I am interested in the opinions of others on this site.  Obviously, I'll add a bug to our defect tracking to make sure this error behavior gets fixed.  But are there any compelling reasons (either way) to either change the regression test to constantly indicate failure or leave the regression test broken and not have a failure until we can get to fixing the defective behavior?  I think of this as a 6 of one and a half-dozen of the other type of question but I ask here because I thought others may see it differently.</p>

<p>@Paul Tomblin,</p>

<p>Just to be clear--I've never considered removing the test; I was simply considering modifying the pass/fail condition to allow for the failure without it being thrown up in my face every time I run the test. </p>

<p>I'm a little concerned about repeated failures from known causes eventually getting treated like warnings in C++.  I know developers who see warnings in their C++ code and simply ignore them because they think they're just useless noise.  I'm afraid leaving a known failure in the regression suite might cause people to start ignoring other, possibly more important, failures. </p>

<h2>Example code:</h2>

<p>By @ajmastrean's request I have <a href=""http://www.fryhard.com/downloads/stackoverflow/ActiveRecordAsync.zip"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">linked</a> to an example that I have (badly) mocked together. The example has a <strong>capture form</strong>, capture form <strong>controller</strong>, <strong>domain</strong> objects, activerecord <strong>repository</strong> and an <strong>async</strong> helper. It is slightly big (3MB) because I included the ActiveRecored dll's needed to get it running. You will need to create a database called <em>ActiveRecordAsync</em> on your local machine or just change the .config file.</p>

<p>Basic details of example:</p>

<p><strong>The Capture Form</strong></p>

<p>The capture form has a reference to the contoller</p>

<pre><code>private CompanyCaptureController MyController { get; set; } 
</code></pre>

<p>On initialise of the form it calls MyController.Load()
    private void InitForm ()
    {
        MyController = new CompanyCaptureController(this);
        MyController.Load();
    }
This will return back to a method called LoadComplete()</p>

<pre><code>public void LoadCompleted (Company loadCompany)
{
    _context.Post(delegate
    {
         CurrentItem = loadCompany;
         bindingSource.DataSource = CurrentItem;
         bindingSource.ResetCurrentItem();
         //TOTO: This line will thow the exception since the session scope used to fetch loadCompany is now gone.
         grdEmployees.DataSource = loadCompany.Employees;
         }, null);
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>this is where the <em>""bad stuff""</em> occurs, since we are using the child list of Company that is set as Lazy load.</p>

<p><strong>The Controller</strong></p>

<p>The controller has a Load method that was called from the form, it then calls the Asyc helper to asynchronously call the LoadCompany method and then return to the Capture form's LoadComplete method.</p>

<pre><code>public void Load ()
{
    new AsyncListLoad&lt;Company&gt;().BeginLoad(LoadCompany, Form.LoadCompleted);
}
</code></pre>

<p>The LoadCompany() method simply makes use of the Repository to find a know company.</p>

<pre><code>public Company LoadCompany()
{
    return ActiveRecordRepository&lt;Company&gt;.Find(Setup.company.Identifier);
}
</code></pre>

<p>The rest of the example is rather generic, it has two domain classes which inherit from a base class, a setup file to instert some data and the repository to provide the <strong>ActiveRecordMediator</strong> abilities.</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> Just to clarify the use case here: I currently store numbers in a single varchar field, and I leave them just as the customer entered them.  Then, when the number is needed by code, I normalize it.  The problem is that if I want to query a few million rows to find matching phone numbers, it involves a function, like</p>

<pre><code>where dbo.f_normalizenum(num1) = dbo.f_normalizenum(num2)

<p>Originally, I just sent the player's input to the server, simulated there, and broadcast changes in the game state to all players.  This made cheating difficult, but under high latency things were a little difficult to control, since you dont see the results of your own actions immediately.</p>

Also, I'm not sure what to do when players start manipulating the environment, pushing rocks and the like.  These previously neutral objects would temporarily become objects the client needs to send PDUs about, or perhaps multiple players do at once.  Whose PDUs would win?  When would the objects stop being doubly tracked by each player (to compare with the dead reckoned version)?  Heaven forbid two players engage in a sumo match (e.g. start pushing each other).</p>

The experience I have with dynamic languages is stuff like ASP (Vb Script), JavaScript, and PHP.  Using these technologies has left a bad taste in my mouth when thinking about dynamic languages.  Things that usually would have been caught by the compiler such as misspelled variable names and assigning an value of the wrong type to a variable don't occur until runtime.  And even then, you may not notice an error, as it just creates a new variable, and assigns some default value.  I've also never seen intellisense work well in a dynamic language, since, well, variables don't have any explicit type.</p>

<p>The general example of doing things is: {controller}/{action}/{id}</p>

<p>So in the scenario of doing a product search for a store you'd have:</p>

<pre><code>public class ProductsController: Controller
{
    public ActionResult Search(string id) // id being the search string

<p>Say you had a few stores to do this and you wanted that consistently, is there any way to then have: {category}/{controller}/{action}/{id}</p>

<p>So that you could have a particular search for a particular store, but use a different search method for a different store?</p>

<p>(If you required the store name to be a higher priority than the function itself in the url)</p>

I have a MVC APP that only has the barebone Global.asax and that loads in other app domains some dlls that are mvc apps.. and the comunication is done through a transparent proxy created through _appDomain.CreateInstanceAndUnwrap(...).</p>

<p>Hope this is clear enough.</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> from what I can tell the codebehind Default.aspx is invoked on the first page reguest and that starts the MvcHttpHandler that does all the voodoo of displaying the pages we are requesting. So it might just be a matter of passing the http context.

<p>Let's be practical, and leave the C++ standard, which is not very helpful in this respect, aside for a minute. If I want to write an app for Windows and Mac (and optionally Linux) that supports C++ plug-ins, and if I want to give plug-in authors a reasonably large choice of compilers (say less than 2 year old versions of Visual C++, GCC or Intel's C++ compiler), what features of C++ could I count on?</p>

43324,"<p>I'm using the Yahoo Uploader, part of the Yahoo UI Library, on my ASP.Net website to allow users to upload files. For those unfamiliar, the uploader works by using a Flash applet to give me more control over the FileOpen dialog.  I can specify a filter for file types, allow multiple files to be selected, etc. It's great, but it has the following documented limitation:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Because of a known Flash bug, the Uploader running in Firefox in Windows does not send the correct cookies with the upload; instead of sending Firefox cookies, it sends Internet Explorer’s cookies for the respective domain. As a workaround, we suggest either using a cookieless upload method or appending document.cookie to the upload request.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, if a user is using Firefox, I can't rely on cookies to persist their session when they upload a file. I need their session because I need to know who they are! As a workaround, I'm using the Application object thusly:</p>

<pre><code>Guid UploadID = Guid.NewGuid();
Application.Add(Guid.ToString(), User);
</code></pre>

<p>So, I'm creating a unique ID and using it as a key to store the <code>Page.User</code> object in the Application scope. I include that ID as a variable in the POST when the file is uploaded. Then, in the handler that accepts the file upload, I grab the User object thusly:</p>

<pre><code>IPrincipal User = (IPrincipal)Application[Request.Form[""uploadid""]];
</code></pre>

<p>This actually works, but it has two glaring drawbacks: </p>

<ul>
<li><p>If IIS, the app pool, or even just the application is restarted between the time the user visits the upload page, and actually uploads a file, their ""uploadid"" is deleted from application scope and the upload fails because I can't authenticate them.</p></li>
<li><p>If I ever scale to a web farm (possibly even a web garden) scenario, this will completely break. I might not be worried, except I do plan on scaling this app in the future.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Does anyone have a better way? Is there a way for me to pass the actual ASP.Net session ID in a POST variable, then use that ID at the other end to retrieve the session?</p>

43368,"<p>I'm a firm believer of the heretic thought of tight coupling between the backend and frontend: I want existing, implied knowledge about a backend to be automatically made use of when generating user interfaces. E.g., if a VARCHAR column has a maximum with of 20 characters, there GUIs should automatically constrain the user from typing more than 20 characters in a related form field.</p>

<p>And I have strong antipathy to ORMs which want to define my database tables, or are based on some hack where every table needs to have extra numeric ID columns because of the ORM.</p>

<p>I've looked a bit into Python database frameworks and I think I can conclude the SQLAlchemy fits best to my mentality.</p>

<p>Now, I need to find a web application framework which fits naturally with SQLAlchemy (or an equivalent) and perhaps even with my appetite for coupling. With ""web application framework"", I mean products/project such as Pyhons, Django, TurboGears, web2py, etc.</p>

<p>E.g., it should ideally be able to:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>automatically select a suitable form widget</strong> for data entering a given column if told to do so; e.g., if the column has a foreign key to a column with 10 different values, widget should display the 10 possible values as a dropdown</li>
<li><strong>auto-generate javascript form validation code</strong> which gives the end-user quick error feedback if a string is entered into a field which is about to end up in an INTEGER column, etc</li>
<li>auto-generate a <strong>calendar widget</strong> for data which will end up in a DATE column</li>
<li><strong>hint NOT NULL constraints</strong> as javascript which complains about empty or whitespace-only data in a related input field</li>
<li>generate javascript validation code which matches relevant (simple) <strong>CHECK-constraints</strong></li>
<li>make it easy to <strong>avoid SQL injection</strong>, by using prepared statements and/or validation of externally derived data</li>
<li>make it easy to <strong>avoid cross site scripting</strong> by automatically escape outgoing strings when appropriate</li>
<li><strong>make use of constraint names</strong> to generate somewhat user friendly error messages in case a constrataint is violated</li>
</ul>

<p>All this should happen dynamically, so table adjustments are automatically reflected on the frontend - probably with a caching mechanism, so that all the model introspection wouldn't kill performance. In other words, I don't want to repeat my model definition in an XML file (or alike) when it has already been carefully been defined in my database.</p>

<p>The application need to prefetch a batch of 100 IDs from a sequence. It's relatively easy to do in a single-threaded, non-distributed environment, you can just issue these queries:</p>

<pre><code>select seq.nextval from dual;
alter sequence seq increment by 100;
select seq.nextval from dual;
</code></pre>

<p>The first select fetches the first sequence ID that the application can use, the second select returns the last one that can be used.</p>

<p>Things get way more interesting in a multithreaded environment. You can't be sure that before the second select another thread doesn't increase the sequence by 100 again. This issue can be solved by synchronizing the access on the Java side - you only let one thread begin fetching the IDs at one time.</p>

<p>The situation becomes really hard when you can't synchronize because parts of the application doesn't run on the same JVM, not even on the same physical machine. I found some references on forums that others have problems with solving this problem too, but none of the answers are really working not to mention being reasonable.</p>

<li><p>The solution by Matthew works when you can use a fixed increment value (which is perfectly acceptable in my case). However is there a solution when you don't want to fix the size of the increment, but want to adjust it dynamically?</p></li>

<p>If I have a Dictionary which I'm access through properties, which of these formats would you prefer for the property?</p>

<pre><code>/// &lt;summary&gt;
/// This class's FirstProperty property
/// &lt;/summary&gt;
[DefaultValue(""myValue"")]
public string FirstProperty {
    get {
        return Dictionary[""myKey""];
    }
    set {
        Dictionary[""myKey""] = value;
    }
</code></pre>

<p>This is probably the typical way of doing it. It's fairly efficient, easy to understand, etc. The only disadvantage is with a longer or more complex key it would be possible to misspell it or change only one instance or something, leading me to this:</p>

<pre><code>/// &lt;summary&gt;
/// This class's SecondProperty property
/// &lt;/summary&gt;
[DefaultValue(""myValue"")]
private const string DICT_MYKEY = ""myKey""

    }
    set {
        Dictionary[DICT_MYKEY] = value;
    }

<p>Which is marginally more complicated, but seems to offer additional safety, and is closer to what I would think of as the ""Code Complete"" solution.

<hr>

<p>@Gaius,</p>

<p>That is the question that a database designer needs to weigh--what is the probable stability of the database structure?  Given a long-enough horizon nothing is stable. Or to say the converse, given a long-enough horizon, everything is subject to change.  A surrogate key (in theory) should never change its meaning because it never had meaning to begin with.  </p>

<p>I guess the other thing to consider in that particular design scenario is who is it that will be seeing the primary key?  If the primary key is something that end-users will actually need to refer to then it makes sense to make it something they can understand.  But I can't think of many cases where an end-user needs to see a primary key; usually the primary key is present to allow the DB engine to speed up certain operations.</p>

<p>My original thought in asking the question was to find design patterns for database design that were codified by more experienced database designers than myself so as to, hopefully, avoid some easily avoidable errors.  It would be interesting reading if anyone had ever codified database design anti-patterns. </p>

44391,"<p>This is related to <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/43324/can-i-put-an-aspnet-session-id-in-a-hidden-form-field"">another question I asked</a>. In summary, I have a special case of a URL where, when a form is POSTed to it, I can't rely on cookies for authentication or to maintain the user's session, but I somehow need to know who they are, and I need to know they're logged in!</p>

<p>I think I came up with a solution to my problem, but it needs fleshing out. Here's what I'm thinking. I create a hidden form field called ""username"", and place within it the user's username, encrypted. Then, when the form POSTs, even though I don't receive any cookies from the browser, I know they're logged in because I can decrypt the hidden form  field and get the username.</p>

<p>The major security flaw I can see is replay attacks. How do I prevent someone from getting ahold of that encrypted string, and POSTing as that user? I know I can use SSL to make it harder to steal that string, and maybe I can rotate the encryption key on a regular basis to limit the amount of time that the string is good for, but I'd really like to find a bulletproof solution. Anybody have any ideas? Does the ASP.Net ViewState prevent replay? If so, how do they do it?</p>

<p><strong>Edit</strong>: I'm hoping for a solution that doesn't require anything stored in a database. Application state would be okay, except that it won't survive an IIS restart or work at all in a web farm or garden scenario. I'm accepting Chris's answer, for now, because I'm not convinced it's even possible to secure this without a database.

<p>I would like to have a button control defined within the updatepanel itself (tried moving it outside and got some catastrophic error, so left it there) that  makes the current panel not visible and a sibling panel visible. This works with the exception that the button must be clicked twice. Not double clicked, but clicked once than clicked again. </p>

However, with the second button being clicked there's an unwanted bonus of a third panel being displayed, the third panel being made visible due to the second button being clicked.</p>

We are looking at enterprise tools that could help but it would be a while before they are implemented (and cost a lot). But is there anything out there that could help out quickly and cheaply? One tool in particular (AmberPoint) can tap into IIS on the servers and monitor inbound and outbound traffic, adds a little special sauce and begin to build a map of the traffic.

44715,"<p>Ruby setters—whether created by <code>(c)attr_accessor</code> or manually—seem to be the only methods that need <code>self.</code> qualification when accessed within the class itself.  This seems to put Ruby alone the world of languages:</p>

<ul>
<li>All methods need <code>self</code>/<code>this</code> (like Perl, and I think Javascript)</li>
<li>No methods require <code>self</code>/<code>this</code> is (C#, Java)</li>
<li>Only setters need <code>self</code>/<code>this</code> (Ruby?)</li>
</ul>

<p>The best comparison is C# vs Ruby, because both languages support accessor methods which work syntactically just like class instance variables: <code>foo.x = y</code>, <code>y = foo.x</code> . C# calls them properties.</p>

<p>Here's a simple example; the same program in Ruby then C#:</p>

<pre><code>class A
  def qwerty; @q; end                   # manual getter
  def qwerty=(value); @q = value; end   # manual setter, but attr_accessor is same 
  def asdf; self.qwerty = 4; end        # ""self."" is necessary in ruby?
  def xxx; asdf; end                    # we can invoke nonsetters w/o ""self.""
  def dump; puts ""qwerty = #{qwerty}""; end
end

a = A.new
a.xxx
a.dump
</code></pre>

<p>take away the <code>self.qwerty =()</code> and it fails (Ruby 1.8.6 on Linux &amp; OS X).  Now C#:</p>

<pre><code>using System;

public class A {
  public A() {}
  int q;
  public int qwerty {
    get { return q; }
    set { q = value; }
  }
  public void asdf() { qwerty = 4; } // C# setters work w/o ""this.""
  public void xxx()  { asdf(); }     // are just like other methods
  public void dump() { Console.WriteLine(""qwerty = {0}"", qwerty); }
}

public class Test {
  public static void Main() {
    A a = new A();
    a.xxx();
    a.dump();
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Question: Is this true?  Are there other occasions besides setters where self is necessary? I.e., are there other occasions where a Ruby method <em>cannot</em> be invoked <em>without</em> self?</p>

<p>There are certainly lots of cases where self <em>becomes</em> necessary.  This is not unique to Ruby, just to be clear:</p>

<pre><code>using System;

public class A {
  public A() {}
  public int test { get { return 4; }}
  public int useVariable() {
    int test = 5;
    return test;
  }
  public int useMethod() {
    int test = 5;
    return this.test;
  }
}

public class Test {
  public static void Main() {
    A a = new A();
    Console.WriteLine(""{0}"", a.useVariable()); // prints 5
    Console.WriteLine(""{0}"", a.useMethod());   // prints 4
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Same ambiguity is resolved in same way.  But while subtle I'm asking about the case where </p>

<ul>
<li>A method <em>has</em> been defined, and</li>
<li><em>No</em> local variable has been defined, and</li>
</ul>

<p>we encounter</p>

<pre><code>qwerty = 4
</code></pre>

<p>which is ambiguous—is this a method invocation or an new local variable assignment?</p>

<hr>

<p>@Mike Stone</p>

<p>Hi!  I understand and appreciate the points you've made and your 
example was great.  Believe me when I say, if I had enough reputation,
I'd vote up your response.  Yet we still disagree: </p>

<ul>
<li>on a matter of semantics, and</li>
<li>on a central point of fact</li>
</ul>

<p>First I claim, not without irony, we're having a semantic debate about the 
meaning of 'ambiguity'.</p>

<p>When it comes to parsing and programming language semantics (the subject 
of this question), surely you would admit a broad spectrum of the notion 
'ambiguity'.  Let's just adopt some random notation: </p>

<ol>
<li>ambiguous: lexical ambiguity (lex must 'look ahead')</li>
<li>Ambiguous: grammatical ambiguity (yacc must defer to parse-tree analysis)</li>
<li>AMBIGUOUS: ambiguity knowing everything at the moment of execution</li>
</ol>

<p>(and there's junk between 2-3 too).  All these categories are resolved by 
gathering more contextual info, looking more and more globally.  So when you 
say,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""qwerty = 4"" is UNAMBIGUOUS in C#
  when there is no variable defined...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I couldn't agree more.  But by the same token, I'm saying </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""qwerty = 4"" is un-Ambiguous in ruby
  (as it now exists)</p>
  
  <p>""qwerty = 4"" is Ambiguous in C#</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And we're not yet contradicting each other.  Finally, here's where we really 
disagree: Either ruby could or could not be implemented without any further 
language constructs such that,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>For ""qwerty = 4,"" ruby UNAMBIGUOUSLY
  invokes an existing setter if there<br>
  is no local variable defined</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You say no.  I say yes; another ruby could exist which behaves exactly like 
the current in every respect, <em>except</em> ""qwerty = 4"" defines a new 
variable when no setter and no local exists, it invokes the setter if one 
exists, and it assigns to the local if one exists.  I fully accept that I 
could be wrong.  In fact, a reason why I might be wrong would be interesting.</p>

<p>Let me explain.</p>

<p>Imagine you are writing a new OO language with accessor methods looking
like instances vars (like ruby &amp; C#).  You'd probably start with 
conceptual grammars something like:</p>

<pre><code>  var = expr    // assignment
  method = expr // setter method invocation
</code></pre>

<p>But the parser-compiler (not even the runtime) will puke, because even after
all the input is grokked there's no way to know which grammar is pertinent.
You're faced which a classic choice.  I can't be sure of the details, but
basically ruby does this:</p>

<pre><code>  var = expr    // assignment (new or existing)
  // method = expr, disallow setter method invocation without .
</code></pre>

<p>that is why it's un-Ambiguous, while and C# does this:</p>

<pre><code>  symbol = expr // push 'symbol=' onto parse tree and decide later
                // if local variable is def'd somewhere in scope: assignment
                // else if a setter is def'd in scope: invocation
</code></pre>

<p>For C#, 'later' is still at compile time.</p>

<p>I'm sure ruby could do the same, but 'later' would have to be at runtime, because 
as ben points out you don't know until the statement is executed which case 
applies.</p>

<p>My question was never intended to mean ""do I really need the 'self.'?"" or ""what 
potential ambiguity is being avoided?""  Rather I wanted to know why was this
particular choice made?  Maybe it's not performance.  Maybe it just got the job
done, or it was considered best to always allow a 1-liner local to override a 
method (a pretty rare case requirement) ...</p>

<p>But I'm sort of suggesting that the most dynamical language might be the one which
postpones this decision the longest, and chooses semantics based on the most contextual 
info: so if you have no local and you defined a setter, it would use the setter.  Isn't 
this why we like ruby, smalltalk, objc, because method invocation is decided at runtime,
offering maximum expressiveness?</p>

algorithms)</li>

45013,"<p>I know, I would have thought the answer was obviously ""no"" as well, but I am experiencing a strange situation where when I view my site from our staging server it appears slightly larger than when I view it from my local dev server.  I have used Charles to confirm that all of the content -- the HTML, the images, the CSS, the javascript, <strong>everything</strong> is the same.</p>

<p>The ONLY difference in the traffic is that (because the local site is served from the Django development mode server) the response headers look like this:</p>

<pre><code>HTTP/1.0 200 OK
Server  WSGIServer/0.1 Python/2.5.2
Date    Thu, 04 Sep 2008 23:56:10 GMT 
Vary    Cookie
Content-Length  2301
Content-Type    text/html; charset=utf-8
</code></pre>

<p>Whereas on the staging server (where Django is running inside Apache) the headers look like this:</p>

<pre><code>HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Date    Thu, 04 Sep 2008 23:56:06 GMT
Server  Apache/2.2.8 (Ubuntu) mod_python/3.3.1 Python/2.5.2 PHP/5.2.4-2ubuntu5 with Suhosin-Patch
Vary    Cookie
Content-Length  2301
Content-Type    text/html; charset=utf-8
</code></pre>

<p>So, as far as I can tell the only differences are HTTP/1.1 vs HTTP/1.0, the server identifer (Apache vs WSGIServer) and the order of the Date/Server headers.</p>

<p>To elaborate a bit further on the differences in appearance, basically it appears as if the version of the site on the staging server is ""zoomed in"" by about 10%.  For example, the primary logo which dominates our home page is 220 pixels wide but when server from our staging server shows up as 245 pixels wide.  Everything else on the page, (other images, text, spacing, etc) is also proportionately larger.</p>

45202,"<p>I absolutely need to use an IoC container for decoupling dependencies in an ever increasingly complex system of enterprise services.  The issue I am facing is one related to configuration (a.k.a. registration).  We currently have 4 different environments -- development to production and in between.

<p>Long version: I wrote a <a href=""http://con.appspot.com"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">web app aimed at other web developers</a>. I want my app to support the major web browsers (plus Google Chrome) in both presentation and AJAX behavior.</p>

<p>I began on Firefox/Firebug, then added conditional comments for a consistent styling under IE 6 and 7.  Next, to my amazement, I discovered that jQuery does not behave identically in IE; so I <a href=""http://github.com/jhs/app-engine-console/commit/4fe7741ad1856208b565eeab4260a64933929c01"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">changed my Javascript to be portable on FF and IE</a> using conditionals and less pure jQuery.</p>

<p>Today, I started testing on Webkit and Google Chrome and discovered that, not only are the styles inconsistant with both FF and IE, but Javascript is not executing at all, probably due to a syntax or parse error.  I expected some CSS work, but now I have more Javascript debugging to do!  At this point, I want to step back and think before writing piles of special cases for all situations.</p>

<p>I am <b>not looking for a silver bullet, just best practices</b> to keep things as understandable and maintainable as possible.  I prefer if this works with no server-side intelligence; however if there is a advantage to, for example, check the user-agent and then return different files to different browsers, that is fine if the total comprehensibility and maintainability of the web app is lower.
