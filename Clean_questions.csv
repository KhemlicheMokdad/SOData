37851,"Application Control Scripts on Unix  I'm looking for some software that allows me to control a server based application, that is, there are bunch of interdependent processes that I'd like to be able to start up, shut down and monitor in a controller manner.

Maybe it would be possible to repurpose the init scripts?Oh, and as an added complication it should be able to run on a Solaris  or Linux box without installing any new binaries.

37871,"Roaming settings with LocalFileSettingsProvider  On my way through whipping up a Windows Forms application I thought it might have been a good idea to use the settings file to store miscellaneous application options (instead of the registry) and user parameters (window positions, column orderings, etc.). Out of the box, quick and simple, or so I thought.  All works as per MSDN using the default SettingsProvider (LocalFileSettingsProvider), but I do have concerns about where it gets stored and hopefully somebody can provide a solution. Essentially the file ends up in the local application data and in an unsavoury sub-directory structure. (AppData  Local  company namespaceStrongNamegibberish version ).Is there a way to tell the LocalFileSettingsProvider to store the configuration file so the data will roam and perhaps in a less crazy folder structure?

37882,"How can you easily reorder columns in LINQ to SQL designer?  When designing LINQ classes using the LINQ to SQL designer I've sometimes needed to reorder the classes for the purposes of having the resultant columns in a DataGridView appear in a different order. Unfortunately this seems to be exceedingly difficult; you need to cut and paste properties about, or delete them and re-insert them manually.  I know you can reorder columns fairly easily in a DataGridView, however that would result in a lot of hardcoding and I want the designer to match up to the grid.Does anyone know of any easier way of achieving this or is cuttingpasting the only available method?I tried manually editing the .designer.cs file, but reordering properties there doesn't appear to do anything!Edit: Just to make it clear - I want to reorder what's in the LINQ to SQL designer, not what's in the table.

37920,"How do you display a dialog from a hidden window application?  I have developed a COM component (dll) that implements an Edit() method displaying a WTL modal dialog.  The complete interface to this COM component corresponds to a software standard used in the chemical process industry (CAPE-OPEN) and as a result this COM component is supposed to be usable by a range of rd party executables that are out of my control.  My component works as expected in many of these EXEs, but for one in particular the Edit() method just hangs without the dialog appearing.  However, if I make a call to ::MessageBox() immediately before DoModal() the dialog displays and behaves correctly after first showing the MessageBox.I have a suspicion that the problem may be something to do with this particular EXE running as a 'hidden window application'.I have tried using both NULL and the return value from ::GetConsoleWindow() as the dialog's parent, neither have worked.The dialog itself is an ATLWTL CPropertySheetImpl.The parent application (EXE) in question is out of my control as it is developed by a (mildly hostile) rd party.I do know that I can successfully call ::MessageBox() or display the standard Windows File Dialog from my COM component, and that after doing so I am then able to display my custom dialog.

38125,"Strategies for keeping a Lucene Index up to date with domain model changes  Was looking to get peoples thoughts on keeping a Lucene index up to date as changes are made to the domain model objects of an application.    The application in question is a JavaJEE based web app that uses Hibernate.  The way I currently have things working is that the Hibernate mapped model objects all implement a common Indexable interface that can return a set of keyvalue pairs that are recorded in Lucene.  Whenever a CRUD operation is performed involving such an object I send it via JMS queue into a message driven bean that records in Lucene the primary key of the object and the keyvalue pairs returned from the index( ) method of the Indexable object that was provided.    My main worries about this scheme is if the MDB gets behind and can't keep up with the indexing operations that are coming in or if some sort of errorexception stops an object from being index.  The result is an out-of-date index for either a sort, or long, period of time.    Basically I was just wondering what kind of strategies others had come up with for this sort of thing.  Not necessarily looking for one correct answer but am imagining a list of whiteboard sort of ideas to get my brain thinking about alternatives.  "

In this group, we mostly used LabVIEW to write programs for controlling our setups, doing data acquisition and analyzing our data. For the first two purposes, that works quite OK, but for data analysis, it's a real pain. On top of that, everyone was mostly self-taught, so code that was written was generally quite a mess (no wonder that every PhD quickly decided to rewrite everything from scratch). Version control was unknown, and impossible to set up because of strict software and network regulations from the IT department.Now, things actually worked out surprisingly OK, but how do people in the natural sciences do their software development?QuestionsSome concrete questions:What languagesenvironments have you used for developing scientific software, especially data analysis? What libraries? (for example, what do you use for plotting?)Was there any training for people without any significant background in programming?Did you have anything like version control, and bug tracking?How would you go about trying to create a decent environment for programming, without getting too much in the way of the individual scientists (especially physicists are stubborn people!)Summary of answers thus farThe answers (or my interpretation of them) thus far: (--)Languagespackages that seem to be the most widely used:LabVIEWPythonwith SciPy, NumPy, PyLab, etc. (See also Brandon's reply for downloads and links)CC++MATLABVersion control is used by nearly all respondents; bug tracking and other processes are much less common.The Software Carpentry course is a good way to teach programming and development techniques to scientists.How to improve things?Don't force people to follow strict protocols.Set up an environment yourself, and show the benefits to others.

(for example, what do you use for plotting?)Was there any training for people without any significant background in programming?Did you have anything like version control, and bug tracking?How would you go about trying to create a decent environment for programming, without getting too much in the way of the individual scientists (especially physicists are stubborn people!)Summary of answers thus farThe answers (or my interpretation of them) thus far: (--)Languagespackages that seem to be the most widely used:LabVIEWPythonwith SciPy, NumPy, PyLab, etc. (See also Brandon's reply for downloads and links)CC++MATLABVersion control is used by nearly all respondents; bug tracking and other processes are much less common.The Software Carpentry course is a good way to teach programming and development techniques to scientists.How to improve things?Don't force people to follow strict protocols.Set up an environment yourself, and show the benefits to others.

38302,"Pinning pointer arrays in memory  I'm currently working on a ray-tracer in C# as a hobby project. I'm trying to achieve a decent rendering speed by implementing some tricks from a c++ implementation and have run into a spot of trouble.  The objects in the scenes which the ray-tracer renders are stored in a KdTree structure and the tree's nodes are, in turn, stored in an array. The optimization I'm having problems with is while trying to fit as many tree nodes as possible into a cache line. One means of doing this is for nodes to contain a pointer to the left child node only. It is then implicit that the right child follows directly after the left one in the array.  The nodes are structs and during tree construction they are succesfully put into the array by a static memory manager class. When I begin to traverse the tree it, at first, seems to work just fine. Then at a point early in the rendering (about the same place each time), the left child pointer of the root node is suddenly pointing at a null pointer. I have come to the conclusion that the garbage collecter has moved the structs as the array lies on the heap.  I've tried several things to pin the addresses in memory but none of them seems to last for the entire application lifetime as I need. The 'fixed' keyword only seems to help during single method calls and declaring 'fixed' arrays can only be done on simple types which a node isn't. Is there a good way to do this or am I just too far down the path of stuff C# wasn't meant for.  Btw, changing to c++, while perhaps the better choice for a high performance program, is not an option.  "

Even though we distribute compilation, and use incremental linking, recompilation and relinking after small source modifications takes between a few minutes (usually at least ) and close to one hour.

38428,"Positioning controls in the middle of a CheckBox  THis is a followup to my previous question Font-dependent control positioning. It's an attempt to solve the real problem behind that question, perhaps in ways different than the one I was asking about.Example of the problem statement: I want a checkbox that says Adjust prices by <X> <Y> after loading, where <X> is a number---adjustable with a NumericUpDown---and <Y> is either percent or dollars, with the choices being made by a ComboBox.

38501,"Thread pool for executing arbitrary tasks with different priorities  I'm trying to come up with a design for a thread pool with a lot of design requirements for my job. This is a real problem for working software, and it's a difficult task. I have a working implementation but I'd like  to throw this out to SO and see what interesting ideas people can come up with, so that I can compare to my implementation and see how it stacks up. I've tried to be as specific to the requirements as I can.  The thread pool needs to execute a series of tasks. The tasks can be short running (<sec) or long running (hours or days). Each task has an associated priority (from  = very low to  = very high). Tasks can arrive at any time while the other tasks are running, so as they arrive the thread pool needs to pick these up and schedule them as threads become available.  The task priority is completely independant of the task length. In fact it is impossible to tell how long a task could take to run without just running it.  Some tasks are CPU bound while some are greatly IO bound. It is impossible to tell beforehand what a given task would be (although I guess it might be possible to detect while the tasks are running).  The primary goal of the thread pool is to maximise throughput. The thread pool should effectively use the resources of the computer. Ideally, for CPU bound tasks, the number of active threads would be equal to the number of CPUs. For IO bound tasks, more threads should be allocated than there are CPUs so that blocking does not overly affect throughput. Minimising the use of locks and using thread safefast containers is important.  In general, you should run higher priority tasks with a higher CPU priority (ref: SetThreadPriority). Lower priority tasks should not block higher priority tasks from running, so if a higher priority task comes along while all low priority tasks are running, the higher priority task will get to run.  The tasks have a max running tasks parameter associated with them. Each type of task is only allowed to run at most this many concurrent instances of the task at a time. For example, we might have the following tasks in the queue:  A working implementation could only run (at most)  A,  B and  C at the same time.  It needs to run on Windows XP, Server , Vista and Server  (latest service packs).  For reference, we might use the following interface:   namespace ThreadPool{    class Task    {    public:        Task();             void run();    };    class ThreadPool    {        public:        ThreadPool();        ~ThreadPool();        void run(Task *inst);        void stop();    };} "

Ex. a calculator. How are people unit testing data-heavy applications? How are you putting together your sample data? In many cases, data for one test may not work at all for another test which makes it hard to just have one test database?  Testing the data access portion of the code is fairly straightforward. It's testing out all the methods that work against the data that seem to be hard to test. For example, imagine a posting process where there is heavy data access to determine what is posted, numbers are adjusted, etc. There are a number of interim steps that occur (and need to be tested) along with tests afterwards that ensure the posting was successful. Some of those steps may actually be stored procedures.  In the past I've tried inserting the test data in a test database, then running the test, but honestly it's pretty painful to write this kind of code (and error prone). I've also tried just building a test database up front and rolling back the changes. That works OK but in a number of places you can't easily do this either (and many people would say that's integration testing; so be it, I still need to be able to test this somehow).  If the answer is that there isn't a nice way of handling this and it currently just sort of sucks, that would be useful to know as well.  Any thoughts, ideas, suggestions, or tips are appreciated.

38870,"One or Two Primary Keys in Many-to-Many Table?  I have the following tables in my database that have a many-to-many relationship, which is expressed by a connecting table that has foreign keys to the primary keys of each of the main tables:  Assume that each User-Widget combination is unique. I can see two options for how to structure the connecting table that defines the data relationship:  Option  has a single column for the Primary Key. However, this seems unnecessary since the only data being stored in the table is the relationship between the two primary tables, and this relationship itself can form a unique key. Thus leading to option , which has a two-column primary key, but loses the one-column unique identifier that option  has. I could also optionally add a two-column unique index (WidgetID, UserID) to the first table.  Is there any real difference between the two performance-wise, or any reason to prefer one approach over the other for structuring the UserWidgets many-to-many table?  "

39154,"Do you version ""derived"" files?  Using online interfaces to a version control system is a nice way to have a published location for the most recent versions of code.

Yes, released versions of the package can be obtained from elsewhere.

Now, I don't know much about either Windows APIs or VB(A) programming, but the standard Windows file dialog I see most often in Microsoft applications would seem like an obvious choice, but it does not seem to be easily available from Outlook's macros.

What are the best choices for directory pickers in Outlook macros?Two things I already tried and did not find totally satisfactory are (the code is simplified and wo error handling and probably also runs in older Outlook versions):) Using Shell.Application which does not allow me to actually paste a starting point via the clipboard or do other operations like renaming folders:  Set objShell = CreateObject(Shell.Application)  sMsg = Select a Folder  cBits =   xRoot =   Set objBFF = objShell.BrowseForFolder(, sMsg, cBits, xRoot)  path = objBFF.self.Path) Using the Office.FileDialog from Microsoft Word .

39304,"Do C++ logging frameworks sacrifice reusability?  In C++, there isn't a de-facto standard logging tool.  In my experience, shops roll their own.  This creates a bit of a problem, however, when trying to create reusable software components.  If everything in your system depends on the logging component, this makes the software less reusable, basically forcing any downstream projects to take your logging framework along with the components they really want.    IOC (dependency injection) doesn't really help with the problem since your components would need to depend on a logging abstraction.  Logging components themselves can add dependencies on file IO, triggering mechanisms, and other possibly unwanted dependencies.    Does adding a dependency to your proprietary logging framework sacrifice the reusability of the component?  "

39454,"Is there a secret trick to force antialiasing inside Viewport3D in Windows XP?  Under Windows XP WPF true D content (which is usually displayed using the ViewportD control) looks extremely ugly because it is by default not antialiased as the rest of the WPF graphics are. Especially at lower resolution the experience is so bad that it can not be used in production code.  I have managed to force antialiasing on some Nvidia graphics cards using the settings of the driver. Unfortunately, this sometimes yields ugly artifacts and only works with specific cards and driver versions. The official word from Microsoft on this regard is that antialiased D is generally not supported under Windows XP and the artifact I see result from the fact that WPF already does its own antialiasing (on XP only for D).  So I was wondering if there is maybe some other secret trick that lets me force antialiasing on WPF D content under Windows XP.  "

39503,"Modifying the MBR of Windows  I need to modify the MBR of Windows, and I would really like to do this from Windows.  Here are my questions. I know that I can get a handle on a physical device with a call to CreateFile. Will the MBR always be on .PHYSICALDRIVE? Also, I'm still learning the Windows API to read directly from the disk. Is readabsolutesectors and writeabsolutesectdors the two functions I'm going to need to use to readwrite to the disk sectors which contain the MBR?  Edit from from what I've learned on my own.The MBR will not always be on .PHYSICALDRIVE. Also, you can write to the bootsector (at least as Administrator on XP) by call CreateFile with the device name of the drive that contains the MBR. Also, you can write to this drive by simply calling WriteFile and passing the handle of the device created by calling CreateFile.  Edit to address Joel Coehoorn. I need to edit the MBR because I'm working on a project that needs to modify hardware registers after POST in BIOS, but before Windows will be allowed to boot. Our plan is to make these changes by modifying the bootloader to execute our code before Windows boots up.   Edit for Cd-MaN.Thanks for the info. There isn't anything in your answer, though, that I didn't know and your answer doesn't address my question. The registry in particular absolutely will not do what we need for multiple reasons. The big reason being that Windows is the highest layer among multiple software layers that will be running with our product. These changes need to occur even before the lower levels run, and so the registry won't work.   P.S. for Cd-MaN.As I understand it, the information you give isn't quite correct. For Vista, I think you can write to a volume if the sectors being written to are boot sectors. See http:support.microsoft.comkb  "

39525,"Error handling / error logging in C++ for library/app combo  I've encountered the following problem pattern frequently over the years:  I'm writing complex code for a package comprised of a standalone application and also a library version of the core that people can use from inside other apps.  Both our own app and presumably ones that users create with the core library are likely to be run both in batch mode (off-line, scripted, remote, andor from command line), as well as interactively.  The libraryapp takes complex and large runtime input and there may be a variety of error-like outputs including severe error messages, input syntax warnings, status messages, and run statistics.  Note that these are all incidental outputs, not the primary purpose of the application which would be displayed or saved elsewhere and using different methods.Some of these (probably only the very severe ones) might require a dialog box if run interactively; but it needs to log without stalling for user input if run in batch mode; and if run as a library the client program obviously wants to intercept andor examine the errors as they occur.It all needs to be cross-platform: Linux, Windows, OSX.  And we want the solution to not be weird on any platform.  For example, output to stderr is fine for Linux, but won't work on Windows when linked to a GUI app.Client programs of the library may create multiple instances of the main class, and it would be nice if the client app could distinguish a separate error stream with each instance.Let's assume everybody agrees it's good enough for the library methods to log errors via a simple call (error code andor severity, then printf-like arguments giving an error message).  The contentious part is how this is recorded or retrieved by the client app.I've done this many times over the years, and am never fully satisfied with the solution.  Furthermore, it's the kind of subproblem that's actually not very important to users (they want to see the error log if something goes wrong, but they don't really care about our technique for implementing it), but the topic gets the programmers fired up and they invariably waste inordinate time on this detail and are never quite happy.Anybody have any wisdom for how to integrate this functionality into a C++ API, or is there an accepted paradigm or a good open source solution (not GPL, please, I'd like a solution I can use in commercial closed apps as well as OSS projects)?

39847,"Using C in a shared multi-platform POSIX environment  I write tools that are used in a shared workspace. Since there are multiple OS's working in this space, we generally use Python and standardize the version that is installed across machines.

Each platform has GCC available and uses the same shell.  One idea was to have the C compiled to the users local ~bin, with timestamp comparison with C code so it is not compiled each run, but only when code is updated. Another was to just compile it for each platform, and have the wrapper script select the proper executable.  Is there an acceptedstable process for this? Are there any catches? Are there alternatives (assuming the absolute need to use native C code)?  Clarification: Multiple OS's are involved that do not share ABI. Eg.

40242,"What is the best way to migrate an existing messy webapp to elegant MVC?  I joined a new company about a month ago. The company is rather small in size and has pretty strong start-up feel to it. I'm working as a Java developer on a team of  others. The company primarily sells a service to for businessesbusiness-type people to use in communicating with each other.  One of the main things I have been, and will be working on, is the main website for the company - from which the service is sold, existing users login to check their service and pay their bills, new users can sign up for a trial, etc. Currently this is a JSP application deployed on Tomcat, with access to a database done thru a persistence layer written by the company itself.  A repeated and growing frustration I am having here (and I'm pretty happy with the job overall, so this isn't an oh no I don't like my job-type post) is the lack of any larger design or architecture for this web application. The app is made up of several dozen JSP pages, with almost no logic existing in Servlets or Beans or any other sort of framework. Many of the JSP pages are thousands of lines of code, they jsp:include other JSP pages, business logic is mixed in with the HTML, frequently used snippets of code (such as obtaining a web service connection) is cut and paste rather than reused, etc. In other words, the application is a mess.There have been some rumblings within the company of trying to re-architect this site so that it fits MVC better; I think that the developers and higher-ups are beginning to realize that this current pattern of spaghetti code isn't sustainable or very easily scalable to add more features for the users. The higher-ups and developers are wary of completely re-writing the thing (with good reason, since this would mean several weeks or months of work re-writing existing functionality), but we've had some discussions of (slowly) re-writing certain areas of the site into a new framework.What are some of the best strategies to enable moving the application and codebase into this direction? How can I as a developer really help move this along, and quickly, without seeming like the jerk-y new guy who comes into a job and tells everyone that what they've written is crap? Are there any proven strategies or experiences that you've used in your own job experience when you've encountered this sort of thing?

40335,"How to tell which disk Windows Used to Boot  I'm need to find a method to programmatically determine which disk drive Windows is using to boot. In other words, I need a way from Windows to determine which drive the BIOS is using to boot the whole system.   Does Windows expose an interface to discover this? With how big the Windows API is, I'm hoping there is something buried in there that might do the trick.  Terry  p.s. Just reading the first sectors of the hard disk isn't reveling anything. On my dev box I have two hard disks, and when I look at the contents of the first couple of sectors on either of the hard disks I have a standard boiler plate MBR.  Edit to clarify a few things.The way I want to identify the device is with a string which will identify a physical disk drive (as opposed to a logical disk drive). Physical disk drives are of the form .PHYSICALDRIVEx where x is a number. On the other hand, a logical drive is identified by a string of the form, .x where x is a drive letter.  Edit to discuss a few of the ideas that were thrown out.Knowing which logical volume Windows used to boot doesn't help me here. Here is the reason. Assume that C: is using a mirrored RAID setup. Now, that means we have at least two physical drives. Now, I get the mapping from Logical Drive to Physical Drive and I discover that there are two physical drives used by that volume. Which one did Windows use to boot? Of course, this is assuming that the physical drive Windows used to boot is the same physical drive that contains the MBR.   "
40344,"What's the best way to work with SQL Server data non-programmatically?  We have a SQL server database. To manipulate the data non-programmatically, I can use SQL Server Management Studio by right-clicking a table and selecting Open Table. However this is slow for very large tables and sorting and filtering is cumbersome.  Typically what we have done until now is to create an Access database containing linked tables which point to the SQL Server tables and views. Opening a large table is much faster this way, and Access has easy-to-use right-click filtering and sorting.  However, since Access , sorting in particular has been quite slow when working with large tables. The Access database can also inadvertently lock the database tables, blocking other processes that may need to access the data. Creating the Access database in the first place, and updating it when new tables are added to SQL Server, is also tedious.  Is there a better way to work with the data that offers the usability of Access without its drawbacks?  "

41162,"Javascript spinning wait hourglass-type thing  I'd like to indicate to the user of a web app that a long-running task is being performed.

41320,"Working on a Visual Studio Project with multiple users?  I just wonder what the best approach is to have multiple users work on a Project in Visual Studio  Professional.  We got a Solution with multiple Class Libraries, but when everyone opens the solution, we keep getting the X was modified, ReloadDiscard? prompt all the time. Just opening one project is an obvious alternative, but I find it harder to use as you can't just see some of the other classes in other projects that way.  Are there any Guidelines for Team Development with VS Pro?  Edit: Thanks. The current environment is a bit limited in the sense there is only  PC with RDP Connection, but that will change in the future. Marking the first answer as Accepted, but they are all good :)  "

41405,"Working with Common/Utility Libraries  At the company I work for we have a Utility project that is referenced by pretty much ever application we build. It's got lots of things like NullHelpers, ConfigSettingHelpers, Common ExtensionMethods etc.  The way we work is that when we want to make a new project, we get the latest version of the project from source control add it to the solution and then reference the project from any new projects that get added to the solution.  This has worked ok, however there have been a couple of instances where people have made breaking changes to the common project, which works for them, but doesn't work for others.  I've been thinking that rather than adding the common library as a project reference perhaps we should start developing the common library as a standalone dll and publish different versions and target a particular version for a particular project so that changes can be made without any risk to other projects using the common library.  Having said all that I'm interested to see how others reference or use their common libraries.  "

Although I usually prefer to use REST services with JSON or XML, there are some tools I am currently integrating that works only using SOAP.  I already created a first version of the client in JavaScript but I'm parsing the SOAP envelope by hand and I doubt that my code can survive a service upgrade for example, seeing how complex the SOAP envelope specification is.

41499,"Java serialization with static initialization  In Java, static and transient fields are not serialized.

In this example, it makes sense because different versions of the class would get different initial values. Why does any initialization change the serialVersionUID? For example, static String MYSTRING = System.getProperty(foo); also causes the serialVersionUID to change.To be specific, my question is why does initialization with a method cause the serialVersionUID to change. The problem I hit is that I added a new static field that was initialized with a system property value (getProperty). That change caused a serialization exception on a remote call.

41580,"Should I Keep Registering A Failure?  I'm working on an automated regression test suite for an app which I maintain.  While developing the automated regression test, I ran across some behavior that's almost certainly a bug.  So, for now, I've modified the automated regression test to not register a failure--it's deliberately allowing this bad behavior to go by, I mean.    So, I am interested in the opinions of others on this site.  Obviously, I'll add a bug to our defect tracking to make sure this error behavior gets fixed.  But are there any compelling reasons (either way) to either change the regression test to constantly indicate failure or leave the regression test broken and not have a failure until we can get to fixing the defective behavior?  I think of this as a  of one and a half-dozen of the other type of question but I ask here because I thought others may see it differently.  @Paul Tomblin,  Just to be clear--I've never considered removing the test; I was simply considering modifying the passfail condition to allow for the failure without it being thrown up in my face every time I run the test.   I'm a little concerned about repeated failures from known causes eventually getting treated like warnings in C++.  I know developers who see warnings in their C++ code and simply ignore them because they think they're just useless noise.  I'm afraid leaving a known failure in the regression suite might cause people to start ignoring other, possibly more important, failures.   BTW, lest I be misunderstood, I consider warnings in C++ to be an important aid in crafting strong code but judging from other C++ developers I've met I think I'm in the minority.  "

When I work with web designers it is very easy to get them to use ASCX controls effectively, even without any programming knowledge, so that's a definite plus.  But then of course the downsides are the page life cycle, which can be maddening, and the fact that ASCX controls are hard to share between different projects.  Composite controls are share-able, but basically a black box to a designer.What's the model in ASP.NET MVC?

41925,"Is there a standard for storing normalized phone numbers in a database?  What is a good data structure for storing phone numbers in database fields?  I'm looking for something that is flexible enough to handle international numbers, and also something that allows the various parts of the number to be queried efficiently.  Edit: Just to clarify the use case here: I currently store numbers in a single varchar field, and I leave them just as the customer entered them.  Then, when the number is needed by code, I normalize it.  The problem is that if I want to query a few million rows to find matching phone numbers, it involves a function, likewhere dbo.fnormalizenum(num) = dbo.fnormalizenum(num)which is terribly inefficient.  Also queries that are looking for things like the area code become extremely tricky when it's just a single varchar field.[Edit]People have made lots of good suggestions here, thanks! As an update, here is what I'm doing now: I still store numbers exactly as they were entered, in a varchar field, but instead of normalizing things at query time, I have a trigger that does all that work as records are inserted or updated. So I have ints or bigints for any parts that I need to query, and those fields are indexed to make queries run faster.  which is terribly inefficient.

42383,"Java object allocation overhead  I am writing an immutable DOM tree in Java, to simplify access from multiple threads.*  However, it does need to support inserts and updates as fast as possible. And since it is immutable, if I make a change to a node on the N'th level of the tree, I need to allocate at least N new nodes  in order to return the new tree.  My question is, would it be dramatically faster to pre-allocate nodes rather than create new ones every time the tree is modified? It would be fairly easy to do - keep a pool of several hundred unused nodes, and pull one out of the pool rather than create one whenever it was required for a modify operation. I can replenish the node pool when there's nothing else going on. (in case it isn't obvious, execution time is going to be much more at a premium in this application than heap space is)  Is it worthwhile to do this? Any other tips on speeding it up?  Alternatively, does anyone know if an immutable DOM library already? I searched, but couldn't find anything.  *Note: For those of you who aren't familiar with the concept of immutability, it basically means that on any operation to an object that changes it, the method returns a copy of the object with the changes in place, rather than the changed object. Thus, if another thread is still reading the object it will continue to happily operate on the old version, unaware that changes have been made, rather than crashing horribly.

I am using .NET remoting to retrieve periodic status updates from a Windows service into a 'controller' application which is used to display some live stats about what the service is doing.

42515,"Dealing with Latency in Networked Games  I'm thinking about making a networked game.  I'm a little new to this, and have already run into a lot of issues trying to put together a good plan for dead reckoning and network latency, so I'd love to see some good literature on the topic.  I'll describe the methods I've considered.  Originally, I just sent the player's input to the server, simulated there, and broadcast changes in the game state to all players.  This made cheating difficult, but under high latency things were a little difficult to control, since you dont see the results of your own actions immediately.  This GamaSutra article has a solution that saves bandwidth and makes local input appear smooth by simulating on the client as well, but it seems to throw cheat-proofing out the window.  Also, I'm not sure what to do when players start manipulating the environment, pushing rocks and the like.  These previously neutral objects would temporarily become objects the client needs to send PDUs about, or perhaps multiple players do at once.  Whose PDUs would win?  When would the objects stop being doubly tracked by each player (to compare with the dead reckoned version)?  Heaven forbid two players engage in a sumo match (e.g. start pushing each other).This gamedev.net bit shows the gamasutra solution as inadequate, but describes a different method that doesn't really fix my collaborative boulder-pushing example.  Most other things I've found are specific to shooters.  I'd love to see something more geared toward games that play like SNES Zelda, but with a little more physics  momentum involved.Note: I'm not asking about physics simulation here -- other libraries have that covered.  Just strategies for making games smooth and reactive despite network latency.

42620,"SQL Server Views, blessing or curse?  I once worked with an architect who banned the use of SQL views. His main reason was that views made it too easy for a thoughtless coder to needlessly involve joined tables which, if that coder tried harder, could be avoided altogether.  Implicitly he was encouraging code reuse via copy-and-paste instead of encapsulation in views.  The database had nearly  tables and was highly normalised, so most of the useful SQL was necessarily verbose.  Several years later I can see at least one bad outcome from the ban - we have many hundreds of dense, lengthy stored procs that verge on unmaintainable.  In hindsight I would say it was a bad decision, but what are your experiences with SQL views?  Have you found them bad for performance? Any other thoughts on when they are or are not appropriate?

Whenever a project gets past a certain size almost feel an allergic reaction to standard patterns and immediately re-wire it with a Dependency Injection framework.

Though, for Java at least, there are a couple very lightweight libraries which are quite good.  Thoughts? Bad experiences? Or just stop worrying about it?  [EDIT] Re: Description of Dependency Injection itself  Sorry for being vague. Martin Fowler probably describes it FAR better than I ever could... no need to waste the effort.

42828,"Mixing jsp and jsf  I will elaborate somewhat. Jsf is kind-of extremely painful for working with from designer's perspective, somewhat in the range of trying to draw a picture while having hands tied at your back, but it is good for chewing up forms and listing lots of data. So sites we are making in my company are jsf admin pages and jsp user pages. Problem occurs when user pages have some complicated forms and stuff and jsf starts kickin' in.   Here is the question: I'm on pure jsp page. I need to access some jsf page that uses session bean. How can I initialize that bean? If I was on jsf page, I could have some commandLink which would prepare data. Only thing I can come up with is having dummy jsf page that will do the work and redirect me to needed jsf page, but that's kind of ugly, and I don't want to end up with  dummy pages. I would rather find some mechanism to reinitialize bean that is already in session with some wanted parameters.  Edit: some more details. In this specific situation, I have a tests that are either full or filtered. It's a same test with same logic and everything, except if test is filtered, it should eliminate some questions depending on answers. Upon a clicking a link, it should start a requested test in one of the two modes. Links are parts of main menu-tree and are visible on many sibling jsp pages. My task is to have  links: testA full, testA filtered, testB full, testB filtered, that all lead on same jsf page and TestFormBean should be reinitialized accordingly.  Edit: I've researched facelets a bit, and while it won't help me now, I'll definitely keep that in mind for next project.  "

42934,"What do people find so appealing about dynamic languages?  It seems that everybody is jumping on the dynamic, non-compiled bandwagon lately.  I've mostly only worked in compiled, static typed languages (C, Java, .Net).  The experience I have with dynamic languages is stuff like ASP (Vb Script), JavaScript, and PHP.  Using these technologies has left a bad taste in my mouth when thinking about dynamic languages.  Things that usually would have been caught by the compiler such as misspelled variable names and assigning an value of the wrong type to a variable don't occur until runtime.  And even then, you may not notice an error, as it just creates a new variable, and assigns some default value.  I've also never seen intellisense work well in a dynamic language, since, well, variables don't have any explicit type.  What I want to know is, what people find so appealing about dynamic languages?  What are the main advantages in terms of things that dynamic languages allow you to do that can't be done, or are difficult to do in compiled languages.  It seems to me that we decided a long time ago, that things like uncompiled asp pages throwing runtime exceptions was a bad idea. Why is there is a resurgence of this type of code?  And why does it seem to me at least, that Ruby on Rails doesn't really look like anything you couldn't have done with ASP  years ago?  "

Obviously, the byte buffer code isn't difficult to write, but I suspect I'm just missing something which would make my life easier (and the code clearer).So, given an InputStream in and an OutputStream out, is there a simpler way to write the following?byte[] buffer = new byte[];int len = in.read(buffer);while (len != -) {    out.write(buffer, , len);    len = in.read(buffer);}  So, given an InputStream in and an OutputStream out, is there a simpler way to write the following?byte[] buffer = new byte[];int len = in.read(buffer);while (len != -) {    out.write(buffer, , len);    len = in.read(buffer);}   byte[] buffer = new byte[];int len = in.read(buffer);while (len != -) {    out.write(buffer, , len);    len = in.read(buffer);} "
43180,"What are some resources for getting started in operating system development?  One thing I've always wanted to do is develop my very own operating system (not necessarily fancy like Linux or Windows, but better than a simple boot loader which I've already done).  I'm having a hard time finding resourcesguides that take you past writing a simple Hello World OS.    I know lots of people will probably recommend I look at Linux or BSD; but the code base for systems like that is (presumably) so big that I wouldn't know where to start.  Any suggestions?

However, if this web site is deployed to a sub-folder of the main url this won't work.

43223,"Running a Simulink xPC block at a faster rate than the continuous rate  I have a Simulink xPC target application that has blocks with discrete states at several different sample rates and some sections using continuous states. My intention on keeping the continuous states is for better numerical integration.   What creates the problem: One block is reading a device at a very fast rate ( hz). The rest of the application can and should run at a slower rate (say,  or  Hz) because it would be overkill to run it at the highest rate, and because the processor simply cannot squeeze a full application cycle into the . secs of the faster rate. So I need both rates. However, the continuous states run by definition in Simulink at the faster discrete rate of the whole application! This means everywhere I have continuous states now they're forced to run at  Hz when  Hz would do!  Is there a way to force the continuous states in xPC target to a rate that is not the fastest in the application? Or alternatively, is there a way to allow certain block to run at a faster speed than the rest of the application?  "

43243,How does Web Routing Work?  I need a good understanding of the inner workings of System.Web.Routing.Usually we define the RoutesTable. But how does it do the routing?  The reason I'm asking it is that I want to pass the routing to subapps. What I want to see working is a way of passing the current request to mvc apps that work in other AppDomains.Just to make it clear this is what I'm imaginingI have a MVC APP that only has the barebone Global.asax and that loads in other app domains some dlls that are mvc apps.. and the comunication is done through a transparent proxy created through appDomain.CreateInstanceAndUnwrap(...).  Hope this is clear enough.  Edit: from what I can tell the codebehind Default.aspx is invoked on the first page reguest and that starts the MvcHttpHandler that does all the voodoo of displaying the pages we are requesting. So it might just be a matter of passing the http context. If you have any ideas on matter please post your thoughts.

43322,"What's safe for a C++ plug-in system?  Plug-in systems in C++ are hard because the ABI is not properly defined, and each compiler (or version thereof) follows its own rules. However, COM on Windows shows that it's  possible to create a minimal plug-in system that allows programmers with different compilers to create plug-ins for a host application using a simple interface.  Let's be practical, and leave the C++ standard, which is not very helpful in this respect, aside for a minute. If I want to write an app for Windows and Mac (and optionally Linux) that supports C++ plug-ins, and if I want to give plug-in authors a reasonably large choice of compilers (say less than  year old versions of Visual C++, GCC or Intel's C++ compiler), what features of C++ could I count on?  Of course, I assume that plug-ins would be written for a specific platform.  Off the top of my head, here are some C++ features I can think of, with what I think is the answer:  I would appreciate any experience you have in that area that you could share. If you know of any moderately successful app that has a C++ plug-in system, that's cool too.  Carl  "
43324,"Can I put an ASP.Net session ID in a hidden form field?  I'm using the Yahoo Uploader, part of the Yahoo UI Library, on my ASP.Net website to allow users to upload files. For those unfamiliar, the uploader works by using a Flash applet to give me more control over the FileOpen dialog.  I can specify a filter for file types, allow multiple files to be selected, etc. It's great, but it has the following documented limitation:  Because of a known Flash bug, the Uploader running in Firefox in Windows does not send the correct cookies with the upload; instead of sending Firefox cookies, it sends Internet Explorerâ€™s cookies for the respective domain. As a workaround, we suggest either using a cookieless upload method or appending document.cookie to the upload request.  So, if a user is using Firefox, I can't rely on cookies to persist their session when they upload a file. I need their session because I need to know who they are! As a workaround, I'm using the Application object thusly:  So, I'm creating a unique ID and using it as a key to store the Page.User object in the Application scope. I include that ID as a variable in the POST when the file is uploaded. Then, in the handler that accepts the file upload, I grab the User object thusly:IPrincipal User = (IPrincipal)Application[Request.Form[uploadid]];This actually works, but it has two glaring drawbacks: If IIS, the app pool, or even just the application is restarted between the time the user visits the upload page, and actually uploads a file, their uploadid is deleted from application scope and the upload fails because I can't authenticate them.If I ever scale to a web farm (possibly even a web garden) scenario, this will completely break.

43368,"A python web application framework for tight DB/GUI coupling?  I'm a firm believer of the heretic thought of tight coupling between the backend and frontend: I want existing, implied knowledge about a backend to be automatically made use of when generating user interfaces.

And I have strong antipathy to ORMs which want to define my database tables, or are based on some hack where every table needs to have extra numeric ID columns because of the ORM.  I've looked a bit into Python database frameworks and I think I can conclude the SQLAlchemy fits best to my mentality.

With web application framework, I mean productsproject such as Pyhons, Django, TurboGears, webpy, etc.  E.g., it should ideally be able to:  All this should happen dynamically, so table adjustments are automatically reflected on the frontend - probably with a caching mechanism, so that all the model introspection wouldn't kill performance.

The servers all use the same Oracle i database running on a th machine.  The application need to prefetch a batch of  IDs from a sequence. It's relatively easy to do in a single-threaded, non-distributed environment, you can just issue these queries:  The first select fetches the first sequence ID that the application can use, the second select returns the last one that can be used.  Things get way more interesting in a multithreaded environment. You can't be sure that before the second select another thread doesn't increase the sequence by  again. This issue can be solved by synchronizing the access on the Java side - you only let one thread begin fetching the IDs at one time.  The situation becomes really hard when you can't synchronize because parts of the application doesn't run on the same JVM, not even on the same physical machine. I found some references on forums that others have problems with solving this problem too, but none of the answers are really working not to mention being reasonable.

43815,Why won't my 2008 Team Build trigger on developer check-ins despite CI being enabled  I have a Team Foundation Server  Installation and a separate machine with the Team Build service.  I can create team builds and trigger them manually in Visual Studio or via the command line (where they complete successfully). However check ins to the source tree do not cause a build to trigger despite the option to build every check in being ticked on the build definition. Update: To be clear I had a fully working build definition with the CI option enabled.The source tree is configured is a pretty straight forward manner with code either under a Main folder or under a BranchbranchName folder. Each branch of code (including main) has a standard Team Build definition relating to the solution file contained within. The only thing that is slightly changed from default settings is that the build server working folder; i.e. for main this is Server:$main Local:c:buildmain due to path length. The only thing I've been able to guess at (possible red herring) is that there might be some oddity with the developer workspaces. Currently each developer maps Server:$ to local:c:tfs so that there is only one workspace for all branches. This is mainly to avoid re-mapping problems that some of the developers had previously gotten themselves into. But I can't see how this would affect CI.UPDATE: Ifound the answer indirectly; please read below  The source tree is configured is a pretty straight forward manner with code either under a Main folder or under a BranchbranchName folder.

43995,Why is branching and merging easier in Mercurial than in Subversion?  Handling multiple merges onto branches in Subversion or CVS is just one of those things that has to be experienced. It is inordinately easier to keep track of branches and merges in Mercurial (and probably any other distributed system) but I don't know why. Does anyone else know?  My question stems from the fact that with Mercurial you can adopt a working practice similar to that of SubversionsCVSs central repository and everything will work just fine. You can do multiple merges on the same branch and you won't need endless scraps of paper with commit numbers and tag names.  I know the latest version of Subversion has the ability to track merges to branches so you don't get quite the same degree of hassle but it was a huge and major development on their side and it still doesn't do everything the development team would like it to do.  There must be a fundamental difference in the way it all works.  
44005,"Propagation of Oracle Transactions Between C++ and Java  We have an existing C++ application that we are going to gradually replace with a new Java-based system.  Until we have completely reimplemented everything in Java we expect the C++ and Java to have to communicate with each other (RMI, SOAP, messaging, etc - we haven't decided).  Now my manager thinks we'll need the Java and C++ sides to participate in the same Oracle DB transaction.  This is related to, but different from the usual distrbuted transaction problem of having a single process co-ordinate  transactional resources, such as a DB and a message queue.  I think propagating a transaction across processes is a terrible idea from a performance and stability point-of-view, but I am still going to be asked for a solution.  I am familiar with XA transactions and I've done some work with the JBoss Transaction Manager, but my googling hasn't turned up anything good on propagating an XA transaction between  processes.  We are using Spring on the Java side and their documentation explicitly states they do not provide any help with transaction propagation.  We are not planning on using a traditional Java EE server (for example: IBM Websphere), which may have support for propagation (not that I can find any definitive documentation).  Any help or pointers on solutions is greatly appreciated.  "

The tutorials provide simple instructions for setting up apps, models, and views, but there is less information about how apps and projects should be broken down, how much sharing is allowablenecessary between apps in a typical project (obviously that is largely dependent on the project) and howwhere general templates should be kept.

44176,"Searching subversion history (full text)  Is there a way to perform a full text search of a subversion repository, including all the history?  For example, I've written a feature that I used somewhere, but then it wasn't needed, so I svn rm'd the files, but now I need to find it again to use it for something else. The svn log probably says something like removed unused stuff, and there's loads of checkins like that.  Edit --: Please note that what is asked here by the term full text search, is to search the actual diffs of the commit history, and not filenames andor commit messages. I'm pointing this out because the author's phrasing above does not reflect that very well - since in his example he might as well be only looking for a filename andor commit message.

44364,"How can I avoid global state?  So, I was reading the Google testing blog, and it says that global state is bad and makes it hard to write tests.  I believe it--my code is difficult to test right now.  So how do I avoid global state?  The biggest things I use global state (as I understand it) for is managing key pieces of information between our development, acceptance, and production environments.  For example, I have a static class named Globals with a static member called DBConnectionString.  When the application loads, it determines which connection string to load, and populates Globals.DBConnectionString.  I load file paths, server names, and other information in the Globals class.  Some of my functions rely on the global variables.  So, when I test my functions, I have to remember to set certain globals first or else the tests will fail.  I'd like to avoid this.  Is there a good way to manage state information?  (Or am I understanding global state incorrectly?)  "

44391,"How do I prevent replay attacks?  This is related to another question I asked. In summary, I have a special case of a URL where, when a form is POSTed to it, I can't rely on cookies for authentication or to maintain the user's session, but I somehow need to know who they are, and I need to know they're logged in!I think I came up with a solution to my problem, but it needs fleshing out. Here's what I'm thinking. I create a hidden form field called username, and place within it the user's username, encrypted. Then, when the form POSTs, even though I don't receive any cookies from the browser, I know they're logged in because I can decrypt the hidden form  field and get the username.The major security flaw I can see is replay attacks. How do I prevent someone from getting ahold of that encrypted string, and POSTing as that user? I know I can use SSL to make it harder to steal that string, and maybe I can rotate the encryption key on a regular basis to limit the amount of time that the string is good for, but I'd really like to find a bulletproof solution.

44453,"Why does a button control need to be clicked twice?  I've got a web application working using VB and Ajax. I'm using updatepanels to avoid the irritating flicker on postbacks to the server.   I would like to have a button control defined within the updatepanel itself (tried moving it outside and got some catastrophic error, so left it there) that  makes the current panel not visible and a sibling panel visible. This works with the exception that the button must be clicked twice. Not double clicked, but clicked once than clicked again.   In setting breakpoints I discovered the code behind that's attached to the button is actually being executed on the first click, but the panels don't switch as expected. If I click the same button OR worse yet, a different button, the expected behavior of the second panel appearing occurs. However, with the second button being clicked there's an unwanted bonus of a third panel being displayed, the third panel being made visible due to the second button being clicked.  I'm assuming this behavior is due to the updatepanel and its Ajax nature. Is there a way to avoid the second click? Am I misusing the updatepanel? I really wanted to use a modal popup (right out of the AjaxToolKit) but had problems with posting back the data so I opted for this approach.

At any given time, we have - different teams that have the ability to add new web sites or services or consume existing services. We probably have about - different web applications and corresponding services.  Unfortunately, given that we have no centralized control over this due to competing priorities, org structures, project timelines, financial buckets, etc., it is quite a mess. We have a variety of services that are reused, but a bunch that are specific to a front-end.  Ideally we would have better control over this situation, and we are trying to get control over it, but that is taking a while. One thing we would like to do is find out more about what all of the inter-relationships between web sites and the app servers.  I have used Reflector to find dependencies among assemblies, but would like to be able to see the traffic patterns between services.   What are the options for trying to map out web service relationships? For the most part, we are mainly talking about internal services (web to app, app to app, batch to app, etc.). Off the top of my head, I can think of two ways to approach it:  I know, I know, how the heck did you get into this mess in the first place? Beats me, just trying to help us get control of it and get out of it.  Thanks,Matt  "

44715,"Why do Ruby setters need ""self."" qualification within the class?  Ruby settersâ€”whether created by (c)attraccessor or manuallyâ€”seem to be the only methods that need self. qualification when accessed within the class itself.  This seems to put Ruby alone the world of languages:All methods need selfthis (like Perl, and I think Javascript)No methods require selfthis is (C#, Java)Only setters need selfthis (Ruby?)The best comparison is C# vs Ruby, because both languages support accessor methods which work syntactically just like class instance variables: foo.x = y, y = foo.x . C# calls them properties.Here's a simple example; the same program in Ruby then C#:class A  def qwerty; @q; end                   # manual getter  def qwerty=(value); @q = value; end   # manual setter, but attraccessor is same   def asdf; self.qwerty = ; end        # self. is necessary in ruby?  def xxx; asdf; end                    # we can invoke nonsetters wo self.  def dump; puts qwerty = #{qwerty}; endenda = A.newa.xxxa.dumptake away the self.qwerty =() and it fails (Ruby .. on Linux & OS X).  Now C#:using System;public class A {  public A() {}  int q;  public int qwerty {    get { return q; }    set { q = value; }  }  public void asdf() { qwerty = ; }  C# setters work wo this.  public void xxx()  { asdf(); }      are just like other methods  public void dump() { Console.WriteLine(qwerty = {}, qwerty); }}public class Test {  public static void Main() {    A a = new A();    a.xxx();    a.dump();  }}Question: Is this true?  Are there other occasions besides setters where self is necessary? I.e., are there other occasions where a Ruby method cannot be invoked without self?There are certainly lots of cases where self becomes necessary.  This is not unique to Ruby, just to be clear:using System;public class A {  public A() {}  public int test { get { return ; }}  public int useVariable() {    int test = ;    return test;  }  public int useMethod() {    int test = ;    return this.test;  }}public class Test {  public static void Main() {    A a = new A();    Console.WriteLine({}, a.useVariable());  prints     Console.WriteLine({}, a.useMethod());    prints   }}Same ambiguity is resolved in same way.

In fact, a reason why I might be wrong would be interesting.Let me explain.Imagine you are writing a new OO language with accessor methods lookinglike instances vars (like ruby & C#).  You'd probably start with conceptual grammars something like:  var = expr     assignment  method = expr  setter method invocationBut the parser-compiler (not even the runtime) will puke, because even afterall the input is grokked there's no way to know which grammar is pertinent.You're faced which a classic choice.

I can't be sure of the details, butbasically ruby does this:  var = expr     assignment (new or existing)   method = expr, disallow setter method invocation without .that is why it's un-Ambiguous, while and C# does this:  symbol = expr  push 'symbol=' onto parse tree and decide later                 if local variable is def'd somewhere in scope: assignment                 else if a setter is def'd in scope: invocationFor C#, 'later' is still at compile time.I'm sure ruby could do the same, but 'later' would have to be at runtime, because as ben points out you don't know until the statement is executed which case applies.My question was never intended to mean do I really need the 'self.'? or what potential ambiguity is being avoided?

But while subtle I'm asking about the case where  qwerty = which is ambiguousâ€”is this a method invocation or an new local variable assignment?@Mike StoneHi!  I understand and appreciate the points you've made and your example was great.  Believe me when I say, if I had enough reputation,I'd vote up your response.  Yet we still disagree: on a matter of semantics, andon a central point of factFirst I claim, not without irony, we're having a semantic debate about the meaning of 'ambiguity'.When it comes to parsing and programming language semantics (the subject of this question), surely you would admit a broad spectrum of the notion 'ambiguity'.  Let's just adopt some random notation: ambiguous: lexical ambiguity (lex must 'look ahead')Ambiguous: grammatical ambiguity (yacc must defer to parse-tree analysis)AMBIGUOUS: ambiguity knowing everything at the moment of execution(and there's junk between - too).  All these categories are resolved by gathering more contextual info, looking more and more globally.  So when you say,  qwerty =  is UNAMBIGUOUS in C#  when there is no variable defined...I couldn't agree more.  But by the same token, I'm saying   qwerty =  is un-Ambiguous in ruby  (as it now exists)    qwerty =  is Ambiguous in C#And we're not yet contradicting each other.  Finally, here's where we really disagree: Either ruby could or could not be implemented without any further language constructs such that,  For qwerty = , ruby UNAMBIGUOUSLY  invokes an existing setter if there  is no local variable definedYou say no.  I say yes; another ruby could exist which behaves exactly like the current in every respect, except qwerty =  defines a new variable when no setter and no local exists, it invokes the setter if one exists, and it assigns to the local if one exists.  I fully accept that I could be wrong.

44789,"How well do common programming tasks translate to GPUs?  I have recently begun working on a project to establish how best to leverage the processing power available in modern graphics cards for general programming. It seems that the field general purpose GPU programming (GPGPU) has a large bias towards scientific applications with a lot of heavy math as this fits well with the GPU computational model. This is all good and well, but most people don't spend all their time running simulation software and the like so we figured it might be possible to create a common foundation for easily building GPU-enabled software for the masses.  This leads to the question I would like to pose; What are the most common types of work performed by programs? It is not a requirement that the work translates extremely well to GPU programming as we are willing to accept modest performance improvements (Better little than nothing, right?).

45339,"Why is my web control null?  I have a web site in asp.net that uses a master page. In this master page I have a multiview control with one view that has all the content for the content pages and one view that has some local content to the master page where I show error messages from all content pages.  In this error view I have a asp.net Label control that displays the error messages. Usually the label works fine, but in some few cases the label is null, which renders a NullReferenceException. Now I have handled this case by checking if the label is null before using it, but still my question is:  Why is this label null? What are the circumstances that can generate this?EDIT: In the master page I have a method called SetErrorText that takes a string and sets the label. I'm calling this method from the content pages' PageLoad method, and this generally works fine. In all but two cases (that I've discovered so far) the label is initialised, and nothing separates these two cases from all the ones that work.Also, all other controls in the master page are initialised, such as the View-control that houses the label.When the PageLoad of a content page rolls around, the master page should be populated.

45582,"How can I convince GroovyShell to maintain state over eval() calls?  I'm trying to use Groovy to create an interactive scripting  macro mode for my application. The application is OSGi and much of the information the scripts may need is not know up front. I figured I could use GroovyShell and call eval() multiple times continually appending to the namespace as OSGi bundles are loaded. GroovyShell maintains variable state over multiple eval calls, but not class definitions or methods.  goal: Create a base class during startup. As OSGi bundles load, create derived classes as needed.   "
45593,"Is there a way to perform a ""Refresh Dependencies"" in a setup project outside VS2008?  I have a solution with several projects. One of them is a setup project. If you expand the setup project in the Solution Explorer, you see a Detected Dependencies node. If you right click on it, you get a menu item called Refresh Dependencies. This refreshes any dependencies based on the files included in the setup.  I am asking if I can execute this action outside Visual Studio, using either devenv.com or MSBuild.  I want this because I am using CruiseControl.NET for continuous integration and in some solutions I found that the setup output is missing some dependencies because of the way I automatically build the projects.  Update:  It turned out that my setup is not very friendly to how Setup projects work in Visual Studio. I ended up using Post Build Events in order to create the whole application structure ready to just be copied to a computer and work out of the box. I am not using setup projects in Visual Studio anymore, unless I really have to.  "
45600,"A issue with the jquery dialog when using the themeroller css  The demos for the jquery ui dialog all use the flora theme. I wanted a customized theme, so I used the themeroller to generate a css file. When I used it, everything seemed to be working fine, but later I found that I can't control any input element contained in the dialog (i.e, can't type into a text field, can't check checkboxes). Further investigation revealed that this happens if I set the dialog attribute modal to true. This doesn't happen when I use the flora theme.
